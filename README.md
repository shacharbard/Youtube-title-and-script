This code is meant to run an app that was created first for use inside a Terminal, but i decided to try and build a Streamlit web app for it
just for the sake of practicing.

The only thing you need, is to have your OPENAI API KEY, which you can get here:
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

The purpose of this tool is to enter a topic for a Youtube video, and the length of the video you want.
it will then generate for you:
1. 10 catchy titles
2. Thumbnails for those titles
3. a script for the video
4. a Twitter thread from the script

after you insert your OPENAI API KEY, it will take 2-3 minutes to generate
all the above, so please be patient!
running this tool will cost you 1-2 cents!!
Have Fun.
